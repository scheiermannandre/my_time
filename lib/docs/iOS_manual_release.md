# Follow the guide provided by CodeMagic 
https://blog.codemagic.io/how-to-code-sign-publish-ios-apps/

# Encountered Problems
1. automatic signing does not work. XCode does not find the Profiles and Certificate for Signing. This might be because of not follwing the guide 
initially and then changing the approach from one guide to this guide.

# Solution
1. change to manual signing, add your team, import the profiles and certificates you already created on https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/
